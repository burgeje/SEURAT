<h2 align = "center">Installing XFeature</h2>
<p>•	First, go to the XFeature plug-in website located at  
<a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/">http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/ .</a>
</p>

<p> •	Navigate to the Download page at 
<a href = "http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/Download.html">http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/Download.html </a>
 or use their site links located on the left side of the page. Scroll down the page and find
 the section titled Download and Installation. Under step 5 is the URL that you will need to
 have so go ahead and copy it now.
</p>

<p> •	From here you will want to follow the typical procedure for installing a new plug-in.
</p>

<p> •	You’ll be asked to review the install details. If something went wrong this is where you
 will get an error, otherwise hit Next. Accept the License Agreement and hit Finish. If a security 
 warning appears just hit Ok.
</p>

<p>•	Restart the IDE you are using.
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>•	Beware path names that have spaces in them. XFeature WILL NOT work with these path names. 
You may have to do some rearranging or renaming of your files if you encounter this problem. 
</p>

<p>•	For helpful Demos that outline the use of XFeature go to 
<a href = "http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/Manual.html">http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/Manual.html </a> 
</p>

<p>•	If looking for .xfmm or .xdm files go to the plug-ins folder for Eclipse, open the XFeature 
folder (com.pnp.xfeature_2.1.3), open src, then FMP_configurations, and there should be the files you want.
