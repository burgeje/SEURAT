<h2 align ="center">XFeature Models</h2>
<b>Family Models</b>: The model used while the project is on-going. This model contains all the 
possible paths that the project could take and will have multiple options <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../pics/Family Model.png"> </p>

<UL>
	<LI>Creating a family model is essesntially the same as creating a normal XFeature Model. <br>
	<LI>Open up Eclipse and in whatever project file you are using go to New -> Other -> XFeature<br> 
			Product Family Modeling Tool -> XFeature Feature Model. Then hit the Next button. <br>
	<LI>On this screen the file is named i.e. example.xfm (Do NOT forget the .xfm extension) and then hit Next.<br>
	<LI>Here you will name the root node of the model (i.e. Example_One, remember that XFeature <br>
			cannot handle spaces!) and then provide the base .xfmm and .xdm files for the model. <br>
			If you don’t know what these files mean there is a handy chart in the XFeature  User Manual (
			<a href = "http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/Manual.html"> here </a>). Also, these files are included with XFeature <br>
			so you don’t need to create them. To find them go to wherever you downloaded Eclipse then go <br>
			to plugins -> com.pnp.xfeature_2.1.3 -> src -> FD_configuration_files and there will be all 
			the files needed.
	<LI>Then hit Finish and your Family Model will have been made.<br>
</UL>

<p>
<b> Application Models</b>: These models reflect the finished product. It is a streamlined version once 
all the decisions for features have been made
</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../pics/AppModel.png"> </p>

<UL>
	<LI> -First of all, remember that application models are based off of an existing Family Model. If you 
			do not have an existing model you will have to create it.
</UL>
<p> Project Files:</p>
<UL>
	<LI>-Once you are ready to make an Application File you will need to first create a project file. Go to 
			New -> Other -> XFeature Product Family Modeling Tool -> XFeature Project File and hit Next. 
	<LI>- Here you will name your project file (i.e. Project.xfp) and hit finish.
	<LI>- Now that you’ve created the project file bring it up in the editor.
</UL>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../pics/project file.png"> </p>

<UL>
	<LI>- From here the meta-model, display model, and xsl files need to be specified.
	<LI>- For the meta model and the display model go to the FD configuration files that come with the plugin and 		
			select the .xfmm (meta-model) and the .xdm (display model).
	<LI>- Next click Add for the Application Meta-Model Generator Files and select both the FdXfmmGenAddUniqueNames 
			file and the FdXfmmGen file (these can be found with the FD configuration files)
	<LI>- Then click Add for the Display Model Generator Files and select the FdXdmGen file. Save and you’re done creating the project file.
</UL>

<p>Validation:</p>
<UL>
	<LI>- Now that the project file has been built it is time to Validate the Family Model. Open the model in the editor 
			and then select the red check mark at the top of your screen. If this is done correctly, a message should print on 
			the console saying that the model was validated.
	<LI>- Next generate the meta-model and display files needed for the application model by clicking the red arrow. If 
			this works correctly the console should say BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Refresh the project to see the newly created files. 
			(they will be named ExampleApp….)
</UL>

<p> Creation:</p>
<UL>
	<LI>-Now to create the actual application model, create a new XFeature Model using the newly created ExampleApp.xfmm and ExampleApp.xdm files.
	<LI>- This model will be the model that SEURAT will export to.
</UL>

<p> If you're still having trouble creating an Application Model, watch the tutorial in the User Manual 
(<a href = "http://www.pnp-software.com/XFeature/Manual.html"> here </a>) under the section <b>From Family to Application Modelling: Scripting </b>
