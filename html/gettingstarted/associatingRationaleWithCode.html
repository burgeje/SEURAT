<h2>Associating Rationale with Code</h2>
Code could be associated with rationale in two directions.<p>Code is associated with rationale by selecting the code in the Package Explorer 
and then choosing &#8220;Associate&#8221; by right-clicking on the alternative. This will 
display the name of the selected code item so the user can verify that this is 
the association they want.</p>
<p>Also, you could select an alternative and then right-click on the code file 
name in the Package Explorer and choose &quot;Associate&quot;. If the item selected in the 
RationaleExplorer is not an alternative or nothing is selected, a Select 
Alternative window will be displayed to inform you to select an alternative. See 
the following figures:</p>

<p>The icon next to the class that contains the code 
will then be marked with a small rat icon. The following figure shows the Package Explorer 
where the classes MeetingDate and MeetingObj have
rationale associated with them.
