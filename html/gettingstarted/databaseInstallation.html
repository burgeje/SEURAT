<h2><font face="Times New Roman">Database Installation</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">SEURAT comes preconfigured to work on
two different database engines. The primary database subsystem suppoted
by SEURAT is Apache Derby. As an alternative to this
pure Java embedded database system, it is possible to configure
SEURAT to connect to either a local or a remote MySQL database server to manage
your rationale. More information about connecting to both of
these databases can be found in <a href="../reference/preferences.html">the SEURAT Preferences help page</a>.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you plan to connect to a remote database and use SEURAT in a multi-user environment,
you should read the <a href="multiUserDatabases.html">Multi-User Databases help page</a>
for important information about synchronization and association issues in multi-user settings.<br>
<br>
This version of SEURAT was designed and tested with Eclipse version 3.3.1;
you may be able to use SEURAT using older or newer versions of
Eclipse, but you are guaranteed the highest level of compatibility
with this version only.
<br><br>
SEURAT was written to utilize some features first introduced in
Java version 1.5. You will need a Java runtime environment (JRE) of
version 1.5 or higher to use SEURAT.

<h2><font face="Times New Roman">Derby</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Derby is fully installed alongside SEURAT
when you use Eclipse's built-in install and update manager.
<br>
Derby can be configured to store the SEURAT database anywhere
on your hard drive. By default, the SEURAT database is stored
in the current Eclipse working directory. This means it will
be easily available and transportable between computers. 
</p>
</font>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman">MySQL</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">
Configuring SEURAT for use with MySQL is not as easy as configuring SEURAT's embedded
database options. First, you must
install a MySQL database server on your local computer or have a user account on a remote server. 
SEURAT is primarily intended for use with MySQL 5.0.
<br><br>
Once you have installed the database server, you will have to
get database tables set up with some initial 
rationale. A .zip file has been made available for this purpose with a database containing empty tables to 
store the rationale and an initialized argument ontology. This file is available from
the SEURAT download directory 
(<a href="http://www.users.muohio.edu/burgeje/SEURAT/Downloads.html">http://www.users.muohio.edu/burgeje/SEURAT/Downloads.html</a>).
