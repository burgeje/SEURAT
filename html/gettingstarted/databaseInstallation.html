<h2><font face="Times New Roman">Database Installation</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the SEURAT plugin, you will need 
to install the following:<br>
<br>
<b>Eclipse (we are using 3.2.1)<br>
Java (1.5.x)<br>
MySQL 5.0 </b><br>
<br>
You will also need to have the database tables set up with some initial 
rationale. We have created a zip file with a database containing empty tables to 
store the rationale and with an initialized argument ontology. This file is available from
the SEURAT download directory 
(<a href="http://www.users.muohio.edu/burgeje/SEURAT/Downloads.html">http://www.users.muohio.edu/burgeje/SEURAT/Downloads.html</a>).
Once you are 
running SEURAT, you can set the preferences to point to the appropriate database 
(in this case, named SEURAT_Base) and to provide the username and password you 
wish to use with your MySQL installation. If you are using an older version of 
MySQL (not 5) you will need to use an account that does not have a password. 
Otherwise, any account with CREATE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE privileges 
will work. </font></p>
