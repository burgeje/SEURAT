<h2>Assumption</h2>
Assumptions are similar to claims except that it is not known if they are always 
true. Assumptions do not map to items in the Argument Ontology.<p>When we create 
or edit an argument, we could select the assumption for or against the argument 
as well as creating a new assumption by click &quot;new&quot; in the select assumption 
window. Or we could edit an existing assumption by right-click the name of an 
existing assumption and choose edit or by double-clicking the name of the 
assumption. See the following figures:</p>

more descriptive if a Description is specified as well.
