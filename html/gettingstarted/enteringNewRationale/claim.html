<h2>Claim</h2>
These are reasons why an alternative is good or bad. Each claim maps to an entry 
in an Argument Ontology of common arguments for and against software design 
decisions. Each claim also indicates what direction it is in for that argument. 
For example, a claim may state that a choice is NOT safe or that an alternative 
IS flexible. This allows claims to be stated as either positive or negative 
assertions. Claims also contain an importance, which can be inherited or 
overridden by the arguments referencing the claim.<p>When we create or edit an 
argument, we could select the claim for or against the argument as well as 
creating a new claim by click &quot;new&quot; in the select claim window. Or we could edit 
an existing claim by right-click the name of an existing claim and choose edit 
or by double-clicking the name of the claim. See the following figures:</p>

<p>The following figure shows the Claim Editor. This is similar to the Argument Editor but with 
fewer fields. The Direction indicates if the claim is that the alternative does 
what the ontology entry says, such as &#8220;IS&#8221; Reduces Development Time, or that it 
does not, as shown here by &#8220;NOT&#8221; Reduces Development Time. The user can also 
specify an importance here or inherit it from the Argument Ontology.<br>
<br>
When a claim is created the user must associate an ontology entry with it. This 
is done using the &#8220;Select&#8221; button. This will bring up the ontology so the user 
can choose an entry to associate.
