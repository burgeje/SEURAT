<h2>Decision</h2>
These are the decisions that must be made as part of the development process. 
They are expressed in the form of questions.<p>In order to create a new 
decision, right-click the &quot;Decisions&quot; in the RationaleExplorer and choose new, 
which will bring up the decision editor. Or we could edit an existing decision 
by right-click the name of an existing decision and choose edit or by 
double-clicking the name of the decision. See the following figures:</p>

<p>The following figure shows the Decision Editor. As with all SEURAT elements, the Name is 
required. There are two types of decisions: one where sub-decisions are required 
and one where alternatives are required. Decisions requiring sub-decisions are 
ones that can be broken into sub-components where answering all the sub-decision 
answers the parent. In this case, alternatives are not present. The example 
given here shows a decision that has alternatives. Each alternative is displayed 
here but added by right-clicking on the decision in the Rationale Explorer. 
Here, a numerical evaluation (rating) for the alternative is given along with 
its name. Higher numbers signify more support.
