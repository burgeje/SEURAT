<h2>Question</h2>
These are questions that need to be answered before the answer to the decision 
problem can be defined. A question can include the procedures or programs that 
need to be run or simple requests for information. While questions are not a 
standard argumentation concept, they can augment the argumentation by specifying 
the source of the information used to make the decisions, which is useful during 
software maintenance.<p>In order to create a new question, right-click any name 
of a decision problem or a alternative under &quot;Decision&quot; in the RationaleExplorer 
and choose New Question, which will bring up the question editor. Or we could 
edit an existing question by right-click the name of an existing question and 
choose edit or by double-clicking the name of the question. See the following 
figures:</p>

<p>The following figure shows the Question Editor. For each question, there is the Status that 
indicates if it is answered or not, a Procedure that describes the steps that 
must be taken to get the answer, and the Answer (once known).
