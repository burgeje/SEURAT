<h2>Requirement</h2>
Requirements include both functional and non-functional requirements. 
Requirements serve two purposes in SEURAT. One purpose is as the basis of 
arguments for and against alternatives. This allows SEURAT to capture cases 
where an alternative satisfies or violates a requirement. The other purpose is 
so that the rationale for the requirements themselves can be captured.<p>In 
order to create a new requirement, right-click the &quot;Requirements&quot; in the 
RationaleExplorer and choose new, which will bring up the requirement editor. Or 
we could edit an existing requirement by right-click the name of an existing 
requirement and choose edit or by double-clicking the name of the requirement. 
See the following figures:<br>

<p>The following figure shows the requirement editor. The Name is mandatory and must be filled 
in. Other fields will have default values. The &#8220;Arguments For&#8221; and &#8220;Arguments Against&#8221;fields are for display only and will have values if this is an existing 
requirement and has arguments associated with it (as is shown here). Note the box 
at the lower left marked&#8220;Enabled&#8221; this is used to disable a requirement to 
determine the impact on the rationale. Requirements that are not yet implemented 
in the current release of the software but are planned for the future can be 
disabled to avoid errors being displayed in the Rationale. A disabled 
requirement will have a &#8220;D&#8221; superimposed on its icon. </p>
