<h2>Finding Associated Rationale</h2>
There are several ways to find rationale associated with the code. If you have 
the code, and want to know if there is rationale, and what it is, the first 
thing to do is to look if there is a &#8220;SEURAT Ratmarker&#8221; in the code, denoted by an &#8220;<img border="0" src="../pics/Rat.gif">&#8221; 
in the left-hand margin. If yes, the name of the rationale can be displayed by 
putting the mouse over the &#8220;<img border="0" src="../pics/Rat.gif">.&#8221; The rationale will also be displayed on the 
Bookmark View (SEURAT ratmarkers are a type of bookmark). The following figure shows the Bookmark View.<p>&nbsp;</p>

associated code, they can bring up the alternative in the editor to see if the 
association has been made, and to what. The following figure shows an alternative with a 
code association listed.</p>

and by clicking the bookmark entry, can bring up the associated code in the 
editor.</p>
