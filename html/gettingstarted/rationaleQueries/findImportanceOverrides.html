<h2>Finding Importance Overrides</h2>

<p>
SEURAT provide a query designed to locate importance settings which have been overridden
from the defaults. Importance settings can be overridden in a number of ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A claim has been given an importance other than that inherited from the Argument Ontology.</li>
<li>An argument refers to a claim and has been given an importance other than the 
default inherited from the claim which inherits from the Argument Ontology.</li>
<li>An argument refers to a requirement and has been given an importance of 
something other than <i>Essential</i>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To perform an importance override search you can locate the <i>SEURAT Search Page</i> from
the standard Eclipse search window. Select the <i>Importance Override</i> radio button
and use the Search Button to execute the query.

The results of the query will be presented in the Eclipse search view. Any of the
table column headers may be used to sort on that column's data. You can double
click on any of the search results to open an editor for the selected rationale element.
