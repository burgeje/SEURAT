<h2>Finding Rationale Entities</h2>
<p>
SEURAT makes it possible to retrieve a list of all the rationale entities
of a certain type (requirements, decisions, alternatives, etc.). From the
Eclipse search window navigate to the <i>SEURAT Search Page</i>. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <i>Entity</i> radio button indicating the search type.</li>
<li>From the dropdown list select the rationale entity type you want to search for.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/findEntity.jpg"></p>
<p>The results of the query will be placed in the Eclipse search view.
Each of the column headers can be used to sort the list of rationale elements
on that column's data. Double clicking on any row in the table will
open an editor which can be used to manipulate that entity. You may also access
additional actions by right-clicking on any of the elements in the
search results.</p>
