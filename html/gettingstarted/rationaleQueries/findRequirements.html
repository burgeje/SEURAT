<h2>Finding Requirements</h2>
<p>
SEURAT provides a query that finds requirements with a specific status. This 
makes it possible to retrieve lists of requirements such as those that have
been violated, addressed or satisfied. To locate requirements which have
a certain status:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the <i>SEURAT Search Page</i> from the Eclipse search window.</li>
<li>Select the <i>Requirement</i> radio button to indicate the search type.</li>
<li>Use the drop down list to select the Requirement Status which you wish to search for.</li>
<li>Click the Search button to execute the query.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The results of the search will be placed in the Eclipse search view. Each requirement
will be listed in a table along with any arguments associated with that requirement. You may
click on any of the column headers to sort the requirements based on that column's data. 
Double clicking on a row of the table will open the associated requirement in an editor
which can be used to make modifications. Right clicking on any of the rows in the table will
display a context menu containing additional actions you can perform.
