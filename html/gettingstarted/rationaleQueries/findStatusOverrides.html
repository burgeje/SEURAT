<h2>Find Status Overrides</h2>
The user can choose to override any of the items given in the Rationale Task 
List. This will keep the error or warning from being displayed in the list or 
indicated by an error or warning icon in the Rationale Explorer. The list of 
overridden items can be shown by choosing &#8220;Find Status Overrides&#8221; in the 
Rationale Query menu. The following figure shows the Status Overrides display. The user can 
remove any override from this list and the Rationale Task List and Rationale 
Explorer will be updated when they exit from the display.
