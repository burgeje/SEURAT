<h2>Finding Status Overrides</h2>
<p>
SEURAT has the ability to locate status overrides which have been made 
to the Rationale Task List. A status override prevents errors and warnings
caused by rationale status conflicts from being displayed in the 
task list. To search for status overrides locate the <i>SEURAT Search Page</i>
from the Eclipse search window. Select the <i>Status Override</i> radio button
to indicate the search type. Click the search button to execute the query.

<p>
The results of the status override query will be placed in the Eclipse search view. Each
overridden status element will be displayed as row in the table with some other
information helping to identify it. Double clicking on any row in the search results
will open the rationale element associated with the status override to open in an
editor. Additional actions are available by right clicking on a selected row in
the search results.
