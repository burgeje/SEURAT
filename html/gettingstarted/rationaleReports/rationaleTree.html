<h2>Rationale Tree</h2>
<p>The Rationale Tree report lets the user output their entire rationale tree or
some sub-tree that they select.  This allows the rationale contained in a database
to be viewed in a format that does not require Eclipse, the SEURAT plugin, and a loaded
rationale database.</p>
To start the dialog, the user right-clicks an element of the tree and selects
"Generate Rationale Report From Here".  This will generate a rationale tree report using the selected
element as the root.  To generate a report of the entire tree, use the top element.  The following screen
will then be displayed:<p>&nbsp;</p>

The user then selects which format to export the Rationale Tree in.  The user can select "Preview" to bring up
a view of the report in Eclipse, or "Save Report" to save the report to disk.
The following is an example preview of a plain text Rationale Tree report:
