<h2>Rationale Status Displays</h2>
When problems are detected in the rationale, they are displayed in the Rationale 
Task List. The icon next to the problem indicates if it is an error or a 
warning. The task states what the problem is, what rationale item it is 
associated with, and the type of the rationale item. Right-clicking on the task 
and selecting &#8220;View&#8221; will bring the rationale up in the editor. If the problem 
is one that the user wants to ignore, they can override the task by selecting 
&#8220;Override&#8221; when right-clicking on the task. This will not delete the task, it 
will just stop displaying it. The following figure shows the Rationale Task List.<p>&nbsp;</p>
