<h2>Restoring Rationale Associations, and Maintaining Associations in a Multi-User Database</h2>
<p>If you are using a multi-user database, there are some difficulties involved with the maintenance of
associations.  Associations are tracked using markers, which are saved locally in the workspace and cannot
be stored persistently.  To get around this in a multi-user database, it is necessary to reload the
associations from the database if significant changes have occurred to the code containing the associations.</p>

<p>Associations are restored automatically when a database is loaded.  In addition, you can restore them
manually by using the "Restore Associations" option on the Rationale Explorer drop-down menu, as demonstrated
below.  When this is selected, the SEURAT system will go through the associations in the rationale database
and update the association markers on the local workspace.</p>
