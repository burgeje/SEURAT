<h2>Displaying Rationale Items</h2>
There are two places where disabling an item would be useful. One is with the 
assumptions made when developing a system. If the assumption no longer holds 
true in the future, those decisions should be revisited. SEURAT can be used to 
find where the code might need to be modified. The other useful place is with 
requirements. If a requirement no longer is valid then it is good to know what 
alternatives were chosen in order to meet the requirement and what alternatives 
were rejected because they violated the requirement.
