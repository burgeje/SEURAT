<h2>Modifying Importance Values</h2>
One thing that can help find places where decisions should be re-visited is to 
modify the importance values and see if that results in any selected 
alternatives being less supported than the non-selected alternatives. For 
example, it might be interesting to reduce the importance of claims that refer 
to alternatives as being easy to code or reducing development cost. This could 
point out alternatives that were chosen because they were easier to code up than 
others. Conversely, making an item in the Argument Ontology more important could 
find places where modification might be needed. For example, scalability could 
be increased in importance to see if there were choices made that were less 
scalable than their alternatives.
