<h2>Corrective Maintenance</h2>
The corrective maintenance task consists of fixing a bug in the Conference Room 
Scheduling system that occurs when the user changes which conference room is 
displayed. The system should show a schedule for the new room for the same week 
that they were looking at before changing rooms but instead it goes back to show 
the schedule for the current week.
<p>The rationale, shown in the following figure, indicates that the decision 
about what room to display when the room changes has an error. This is indicated 
by the red icon overlaying the decision icon. </p>

<p>The Rationale Task list, shown in the following figure, explains that the 
alternative that was selected, &#8220;display meetings for current week&#8221;, has 
arguments against it but none for it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user can find the code that selects which week is displayed by either 
editing the alternative to get the name of the code element or, more quickly, by 
finding the selected alternative in the Bookmark Display. Doubleclicking on the 
bookmark brings up the code in the editor. After making the required change, the 
maintainer should change the rationale to select the correct alternative and 
make sure it is associated with the code correctly.</p>
