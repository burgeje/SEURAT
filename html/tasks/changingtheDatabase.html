<h2>Changing the Database</h2>
<p>The database being used by SEURAT can be changed in one step, by using the <a href="../reference/preferences.html">
Preference Pages</a> to indicate which database should be used.  The database will then be updated.  This can be verified
by the name of the database in use which is near the root of the Rationale Explorer.</p>
