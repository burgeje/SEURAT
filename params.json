{"name":"Seurat","tagline":"Software Engineering Using RATionale Project - an Eclipse plug-in for capturing and using design rationale","body":"#### SEURAT - Software Engineering Using RATionale\r\nSEURAT is an Eclipse plug-in to capture and use design rationale.\r\n\r\nDesign rationale consistes of the reasons for decisions made when designing/developing software or any other artifact. SEURAT supports the following capabilities:\r\n* Allows entry of requirements, decisions, alternatives, arguments, assumptions procedures, questions, and answers\r\n* Links decision alternatives to the code that implements them\r\n* Inferences over the rationale to detect inconsistencies\r\n* Incorporates Pattern and Tactic libraries to assist in selecting patterns and tactics based on the non-functional requirements for your system and to automatically generate rationale corresponding to patterns and tactics\r\n* Integrates with the XFeature plug-in to support feature modeling for product line development\r\n\r\n### More information\r\nSEURAT was originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Development has continued at Miami University. More information about SEURAT, including a list of design rationale-related publications, can be found at [http://www.users.miamioh.edu/burgeje/SEURAT/index.html](http://www.users.miamioh.edu/burgeje/SEURAT/index.html). \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSEURAT was created by Dr. Janet Burge (@burgje). Contributions have been made by Miami University graduate student Wei Wang and undergraduate students Yechen Qiao, John Martin, Sean Hanna, Trey Martin, and Preethi Srinivas.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
