<h2>Alternative</h2>
These are alternative solutions to the decision problems. Each alternative will 
have a status that indicates if it is accepted, rejected, or pending.<p>In order 
to create a new alternative to a decision problem, right-click the name of the 
decision problem in the RationaleExplorer and choose New Alternative, which will 
bring up the alternative editor. Or we could edit an existing alternative by 
right-click the name of an existing alternative and choose edit or by 
double-clicking the name of the alternative. See the following figures:</p>

<p>The following figure shows the Alternative Editor. This gives the information about the 
alternative and lists the arguments for it, against it, and that specify 
relationships. A relationship refers to a dependency on another alternative 
being selected. The Artifact field will describe what part of the code 
implements this alternative. In this example, the alternative has not yet been 
associated with any code.
