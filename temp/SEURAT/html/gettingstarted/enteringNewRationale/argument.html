<h2>Argument</h2>
These are the arguments for and against the proposed alternatives. They can 
either contain requirements (i.e., an alternative is good or bad because of its 
relationship to a requirement), claims about the alternative, assumptions that 
are reasons for or against choosing an alternative, or relationships between 
alternatives (indicating dependencies or conflicts). Each argument is given an 
amount (how much the argument applies to the alternative, i.e., how flexible, 
how expensive) and an importance (how important the argument is to the overall 
system or to the specific decision).<p>In order to create a new argument, 
right-click any name of elements under a decision problem or a requirement in 
the RationaleExplorer and choose New Argument, which will bring up the argument 
editor. Or we could edit an existing argument by right-click the name of an 
existing argument and choose edit or by double-clicking the name of the 
argument. See the following figures:</p>

<p>The following figure shows the Argument Editor. Arguments can be associated with claims 
(which then point into the Argument Ontology), assumptions, requirements, or 
other arguments. In this example, it argues a Claim, which is shown by the 
Argument Type field. When an argument is initially created, it is mandatory that 
it be associated with something. This is done using the &#8220;Select&#8221; button. When 
this happens, the user is allowed to either select an
already existing item to use or create a new one. Each argument gives the type, 
indicating if it is for or against the alternative. The possible values vary 
depending on the type of the argument. These are as follows:<br>
<br>
&#8226; Claim &#8211; supports or denies<br>
&#8226; Requirement &#8211; satisfies, addresses, or violates<br>
&#8226; Assumption &#8211; supports or denies<br>
&#8226; Argument &#8211; presupposes or opposes<br>
<br>
In addition, the user can give the Importance of the argument, the Amount (how 
much the alternative meets the claim), and the Plausibility (how sure they are 
of the argument). The Importance can be specified as &#8220;Default,&#8221; in which case it 
will be inherited from the claim or Argument Ontology. Arguments involving 
requirements or dependencies will default to an importance of &#8220;Essential.&#8221;</p>
