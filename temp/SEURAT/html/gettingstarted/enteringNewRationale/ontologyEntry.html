<h2>Ontology Entry</h2>
<p>Argument Ontology is a hierarchy of common argument types that serve as types 
of claims that can be used in the system. These are used to provide the common 
vocabA-8 ulary required for inferencing. Each ontology entry contains an 
importance that can be overridden by claims that reference it.</p>
<p>In order to create a new ontology entry, right-click any of elements under 
the Argument Ontology in the RationaleExplorer and choose new, which will bring 
up the ontology entry editor. Or we could edit an existing ontology entry by 
right-click the name of an existing ontology entry and choose edit or by 
double-clicking the name of the ontology entry. See the following figures: </p>

<p>The following figure shows the Ontology Entry Editor. This describes the entry and gives its 
Importance. This Importance will be inherited by any claims that reference the 
ontology entry.</p>
