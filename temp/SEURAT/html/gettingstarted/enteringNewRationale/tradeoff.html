<h2>Tradeoff</h2>
The following figure shows the Tradeoff Editor. Tradeoffs are made between two Ontology 
Entry items. Tradeoffs can be symmetric, which indicates that they are always 
traded off against each other, or non-symmetric, which means the dependency is 
one-way. For example, in this non-symmetric tradeoff, Ontology Entry 1, 
Increases Flexibility, always needs to be traded off against Ontology Entry 2, 
Reduces Development Time. This means that if a choice increases flexibility it 
will increase development time. The other way around, however, is not true&#8211;if a 
choice increases development time it is not necessarily because of added 
flexibility.<p>&nbsp;</p>
