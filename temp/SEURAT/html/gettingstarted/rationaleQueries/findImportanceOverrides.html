<h2>Find Importance Overrides</h2>
The user can also display a list of all claims and arguments where the default 
importance has been overridden. This can happen in several ways:<br>
<br>
&#8226; A claim (which could be used by many arguments) has been given an importance 
other than the default inherited from the Argument Ontology.<br>
&#8226; An argument that refers to a claim has been given an importance other than the 
default inherited from the claim (which inherits from the Argument Ontology)<br>
&#8226; An argument that refers to a requirement has been given an importance of 
something other than &#8220;Essential.&#8221;<br>
<br>
This display is brought up by selecting &#8220;Find Importance Overrides&#8221; from the 
Rationale Query Menu. The following figure shows the Importance Override Display.<p>&nbsp;</p>
