<p align="left">This then brings up a list of items of that type, as shown in 
the following figure. The user can
search for all or part of the item name to find it in the list. After find it, 
the user then can bring up the item in an editor by using the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button. The 
user can also choose to expand it in the hierarchy shown in the Rationale 
Explorer by using the &#8220;Show&#8221; button. This is helpful if the user wants to know 
the context around the entity.</p>
