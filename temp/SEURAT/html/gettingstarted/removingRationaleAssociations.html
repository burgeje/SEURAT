<h2>Removing Rationale Association</h2>Associations can be removed in two ways. 
The first is by right-clicking on the class in the Package Explorer and choosing 
&#8220;Remove Association.&#8221; This will delete all associations for the file. The other, 
which is more selective, is by right-clicking on the bookmark in the Bookmark 
View and choosing &#8220;Remove Association.&#8221; This will only remove the association 
that goes with that specific bookmark. This is useful if you do not want to 
remove all associations with the file. It is also possible to remove bookmarks 
by choosing &#8220;Delete&#8221; but that will not remove the association even though it 
will remove it from the display.
