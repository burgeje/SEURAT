<h2>Changing Design Priorities</h2>

<p>Design priorities are expressed in the rationale by the importance given to 
the items in the Argument Ontology. SEURAT allows arguments and claims to 
inherit importance values from the Argument Ontology. These importance values 
are used to evaluate each alternative. If the importance in the ontology is 
modified, that value will then propagate through the rest of the rationale. This 
may mean that some alternatives that were selected may no longer be the best 
choice. </p>
<p>For this example, we first looked to see what items in the Argument Ontology 
were appearing the most in arguments concerning selected alternatives. The 
following figure shows the Common Argument Display with Ontology Entries listed 
in the order of the number of references. The one that appears the most often is 
&#8220;Reduces Development Time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then changed the importance value of &#8220;Reduces Development Time&#8221; from 
&#8220;Moderate&#8221; to &#8220;Not&#8221; as shown&nbsp; in the following figure. This caused all the 
claims and arguments that inherited their importance values from it to be 
re-evaluated. This resulted in several decisions where the best alternative was 
no longer selected. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new warning messages generated are shown in the Rationale Tasks Display 
given in the following figure. Note, for purposes of this example all other 
errors and warnings were overridden so they would not appear on the display. 
This capability is very useful because priorities may change over the life of a 
system. For example, reducing development time may have been a primary concern 
when the system was first built because of schedule limitations, but some of 
those decisions may be worth re-examining when time is no longer as constrained.
