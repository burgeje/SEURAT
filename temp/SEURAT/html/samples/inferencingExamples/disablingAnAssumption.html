<h2>Disabling an Assumption</h2>

<p>One of the features unique to SEURAT and the RATSpeak representation is the 
explicit recording of assumptions. Assumptions can become invalid over time, 
which is a key reason for why software needs to continually evolve. It is 
important to re-examine assumptions during maintenance to ensure that they still 
hold. SEURAT lets the user disable an assumption to see the impact that has on 
the rest of the rationale. </p>
<p>The following figure shows a list of all assumptions captured for the 
Conference Room Scheduling System with the assumption &#8220;standard working hours 8 
to 6&#8221; highlighted. </p>

<p>This assumption can be edited from this display and then disabled, as shown 
in the following figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabling the assumption causes the alternative that refers to it to be 
re-evaluated again. This results in a warning for the decision &#8220;schedule 
duration.&#8221; The following figure shows the Rationale Explorer with the disabled 
assumption highlighted. </p>
