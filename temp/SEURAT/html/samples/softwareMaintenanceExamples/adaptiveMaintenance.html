<h2>Adaptive Maintenance</h2>
The adaptive maintenance task concerns the persistent storage of user 
information. The rationale contains a decision &#8220;how to store user information&#8221; 
where the two choices are &#8220;save in a text file&#8221; and &#8220;serialize user 
information.&#8221; The following figure shows the Rationale Explorer with the 
decision highlighted and expanded.<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/adapti9.jpg"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The decision is shown with a yellow warning icon on it because 
the selected alternative, &#8220;save in a text file&#8221;, was not the best choice. This 
is also shown in the Rationale Task List in the following figure.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">If the decision is edited, the arguments for and against it, and 
their evaluation, are shown to the user. The following figure shows the decision 
and that the selected alternative &#8220;save in a text file&#8221; has a negative value, 
while the alternative &#8220;serialize user information&#8221; has a positive one.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/adapti11.jpg"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Displaying the alternative &#8220;serialize user information&#8221; gives 
additional information about that choice and tells how it can be implemented. 
The following figure shows the alternative and the description that tells the 
maintainer that they can use ObjectOutputStream to serialize the user 
information.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The next step is to find the place in the code where the 
information is stored. A logical place to start is to find where the currently 
selected alternative, &#8220;save in a text file&#8221;, is implemented. Editing the 
alternative (see the following figure) shows that it is associated with the 
method &#8220;actionPerformed.&#8221; </p>

<p align="left">If this name is not familiar to the maintainer, they can find 
the code via the Bookmarks Display. The following figure shows the Bookmarks 
Display showing the bookmark that maps the alternative to the code. 
Double-clicking on that alternative brings up the appropriate code in the 
editor. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/adapti14.jpg"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The maintainer can also use SEURAT to find the code where the 
user information is loaded. The following figure shows the Rationale Explorer 
with a decision on &#8220;where to load user information.&#8221; The selected alternative is 
&#8220;load from Login Users class&#8221; and the maintainer can either find this class in 
the Eclipse Package Explorer or use the bookmarks as described above.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/adapti15.jpg"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">After making the necessary changes, the maintainer should go 
back to the rationale and select the new alternative, associate it with the 
appropriate code, and de-select the old one. This is not currently enforced. 
When changing the status for the two alternatives, the maintainer has the 
opportunity to enter a reason for the status change. The maintainer should also 
remove the association to the code from the alternative that is no longer 
selected. </p>
