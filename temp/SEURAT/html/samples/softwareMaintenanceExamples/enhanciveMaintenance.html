<h2>Enhancive Maintenance</h2>
The enhancive maintenance task involves adding a new feature to the system. In 
this case, it involves implementing a requirement that had initially been 
deferred: allowing users with administrative privileges to cancel meetings 
scheduled by other Conference Room System users. This is necessary in case a 
meeting has to be moved due to a higher priority meeting and the originating 
user is not around to do it.
<p>When the requirement &#8220;Administrator can cancel any meeting&#8221; is enabled, it 
shows up as having been violated in two places in SEURAT. The requirement 
itself, as shown in the Rationale Explorer in the following figure, has an error 
icon over it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also an error message on the Rationale Task Display shown in the 
following figure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/enhanc17.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the maintainer looks at the decision list in SEURAT, there are several 
that have error icons on them. One is the decision &#8220;who is allowed to cancel 
meetings&#8221; shown the following figure. This has three alternatives, only one of 
which does not violate any requirements. That alternative is &#8220;owner or 
administrator can cancel meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../pics/enhanc18.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maintainer then needs to find the place in the code that checks if the 
meeting can be cancelled or not. This can be done the most quickly using the 
Bookmarks Display. The following figure shows the Bookmarks Display with the 
alternative &#8220;only owner can cancel meetings&#8221; highlighted. When double-clicked, 
the editor comes up with the appropriate code. When done with the changes, the 
maintainer needs to update the rationale so that the correct alternative is 
selected and the code associations are also correct. </p>
